                <pre>I watch Focalors smile. “Farewell, Neuvillette. I hope you enjoyed the part you’ve played these past five hundred years.” She knew I was a Hydro Dragon, just as she is my Oceanid.
                    She spins on her heel, then begins to dance to a song I’ve never heard. Her movements are fluid and bold like she’s painting swift strokes of defiance on a canvas of fear.
                    The Oratrice glimmers, and she bows. Her silvery hair parts to expose her slender neck, and…
                    …just for a moment…
                    …she could run. She could run from the Oratrice. She could run from responsibility, her debt from the stars. She could run away with me. We could have a happy ending, and the people of Fontaine would be free, and there would be no Oratrice and no Archons–
                    But she doesn’t so much as flinch. The Oratrice makes a sharp whining sound, slamming into the ground and spearing her.
                    The Execution is complete. The throne is destroyed. There will never be a Hydro Archon again.
                    I’ll never see Focalors again.
                    I flinch at the jagged splintering of wood, reaching out to Focalors before pulling back. The power she promised takes the form of sparkling droplets that gravitate to my outstretched hands. One drop appears as power, but in it, I see nothing but Focalors Focalors Focalors pain. 
                    I close my eyes, shuddering. “Hydro dragon, Hydro dragon,” she said, “Don’t cry.” And yet, I cannot escape the painful, wretched tears that prick and stab the corners of my eyes before slipping out and disappearing into Pneuma.
                    As Iudex and Hydro Dragon, I know now that I must obey my Archon. Focalors.
                    I reclaim the last of my power and bound through the ceiling, ricocheting off the ruined Opera Epiclese. I blast through the top of the city barrier, floating high above it. There’s this unbearable pain in my chest that I cannot ignore.
                    I raise my hand slightly. “I, Iudex Neuvillette, hereby declare…” My breath shudders, more tears spilling with the rain. 
                “People of Fontaine, your sins are forgiven.”
                Time seems to slow, the rain infused with tears of sacrifice and love and Focalors lost memories of brilliance. My cheeks burn and I hug myself, feeling dreadfully alone.
                “I told you not to cry, little Hydro dragon.”
                I whip around, tears still in my eyes. Focalors’ spirit is hovering behind me, one gentle hand on my shoulder. 
                She smiles sadly. “I couldn’t ascend to Celestia with a tranquil soul knowing you were grieving so. Do not grieve for me. Your pretty eyes are more beautiful when not spent crying.”
                I press a hand to my chest. “Focalors, please– what the devil is this?” I whisper. “I know not the ways of mortals, and this is nothing of the dragons. What is this feeling?!”
                She sighs, taking my face in her hands. “This is grief. Refreshing, is it not?” She brushes away my tears. “And yet… it’s heart-wrenching, but such a comfort to the wretched.”
                I fall to my knees, gasping for air. “My Archon, it burns, it burns– this maddening grief, deepening sorrows– please, don’t leave me, Focalors!”
                Her smile wavers for just a moment. “Oh, my dearest Hydro dragon, please don’t cry. It will burn. Until then…” She offers me her hand. “...may I have this dance, Iudex Neuvillette?”
                I look up. Her face is framed by droplets of Primordial Water, but her body has begun to dissolve into Celestia. I shudder slightly, then rise and take her hands.
                “As you wish, my Archon.”
                She grins and spins me into that same dance she performed before… before the Oratrice executed her. Except… it’s just a little different this time.
                Her dress flares around her bare ankles, and the stage is the stormy sky. It’s her last performance. My breath catches and I spin her, and she gracefully extends an arm to the clouds, dipping backward over my arm when I do. The clouds roar at her delay, but she doesn’t leave. She wants to stay with me in Teyvat.
                what if she wasn’t dead what if my world wasn’t shattered her body and soul could’ve been mine it could’ve been me it burns it burns it burns
                “It burns,” I whisper into her ear.
                Focalors smiles and pirouettes. “You mustn’t let it burn you.”
                I take her arm and scoop her spirit into my arms. “But Fontaine needs their Archon back. The Seven need to have a Hydro Archon.”
                She leaps through falling droplets of water. “No, Iudex Neuvillette.” Her face is understanding, almost smug. “Why do you care about me so much? Perhaps this runs much deeper than the need for a Hydro Archon. Oh, Neuvillette…”
                My ears burn, and she whispers the words that I don’t want to admit.
                “What if
                “this is about
                “your need for me?” 
                Each word falls into my mind like the crystalline drops of water running down my face to hide my tears and red red red endless shame. I’m so ashamed I don’t need her I can’t have her she can never be mine mine mine–
                “I don’t deserve you,” I say instead, and
                my 
                chest grief love face
                burns. I press a hand to my lips to keep from sobbing, but I can’t stop myself. She puts a fading hand on my shoulder, my breath convulsing, and just like that, we fall from the sky, falling headfirst into the nearby lake outside the Oratrice chamber.
                “Stay with me,” I beg through tears.
                “I cannot,” she whispers sadly. “Celestia bids otherwise.”
                I cry and pull her into my arms and curl around her like it will keep her spirit from ascending, and she smiles, tucking her face beneath my chin. Her breath is gentle and warm, the water parting because of Hydro’s blessing, and I kiss her forehead. “I love you, Focalors, Oceanid and Archon of Fontaine.” Archon of my heart.
                But it’s pointless to try and stop the rushing waters of Fontaine, just as it is pointless to stop a spirit from dissolving into nothing but memories of pain and hurt and bitter regrets
                and also love
                leaving me crying with empty arms.
