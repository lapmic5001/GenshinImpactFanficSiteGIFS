One of the lesser gods–the god of glass, I believe–sprints toward us. Guizhong takes a step back, afraid. I raise my arm and tear his gnosis from his soul. He falls on the other side of the riverbank.
	Guizhong glares. “Zhongli, please! End this madness–”
	“I can’t!” I shout back, stealing another gnosis. “How am I supposed to stop any of this when I didn’t even start it?!”
She grunts and throws the riverbank out of reach, and I raise jagged mountains to surround the Guili Assembly. She digs her heel into the tender earth, raising dust and metals and casting an obscurus over the plain. “The other gods are coming for my gnosis! By protecting me, you only put yourself in danger! Run while they slow!”
	I reinforce the obscurus when some gods slip through. “Well, they want my gnosis, too!”
	“Zhongli-”
	“I’m not leaving you, Guizhong!” 
	I raise mountains to surround the Assembly. “Why are the gods fighting to begin with?!”
	“You don’t understand!” she calls, stealing another god’s gnosis. “There can only be one god to defend Liyue, just as there can only be one god to defend each nation. The rest must burn–it’s turned into war, Zhongli!”
	“Yes, but why do they want your gnosis?!”
	She shrugs, pulling more dust from the air. “Because apparently, they said that everything would crumble if I dissolved into black dust. They want to see if my dust is black.”
	“That’s just wrong,” I shout indignantly. “You’re– you’d never… Your heart is good and kind and full of joy– I mean– your dust is golden and white and beautiful… it just doesn’t make any sense-”
	She nods. “I kn-”
	She chokes suddenly and collapses. A Snezhnayan god is standing over her body with her gnosis in hand.
	My temper flares, and I turn the god to crystal and snap her in half, taking Guizhong’s gnosis. I kneel beside Guizhong. Her eyes are half closed. She’s been stunned.
	I take her in my arms. “Guizhong, can you hear me?”
	She shivers, and silver Vision flows from her back, trickling into my hand and down my arm and sleeve, staining the Glaze Lilies. “I’m… sorry, Zhongli. I f-failed.”
	“No,” I hiss, frantically trying to heal her. “No, please, Guizhong-”
	She takes my hand. “U-use my real name. My Goetic name.”
	I blink, my vision blurry from tears. “Haagentus? Please, you can’t go–”
	She smiles. “Zhongli… Morax… listen.” She stills for a moment. “Do you hear that?” And I hear birdsong, the flowing river, clashing metal, and her quiet voice. Her voice sounds like the amber sun whispering from behind gray clouds. “And h-here.” She rests her hand flat against my chest. “Your heart is like a symphony.”
	I choke on my breath, hiccuping. “Please don’t go,” I whisper in Goetic. My hands feel like the lead beneath the mountains, unable to chase down the Glaze Lilies. The mountains must remain unmoving while the Glaze Lilies blossom in spring, to die in the winter, to find their home elsewhere.
	She laughs slightly. “Oh, Morax… I’m so sorry that our journey together must end here… You were my oldest friend in the Assembly… We built an empire! And yet… like d-dust, everything came crumbling down. The Memory of Dust… don’t think of it too much.”
	“Guizhong, please–”
	“The Memory of Dust does not have a solution,” she whispers. “W-when you agreed to s… solve it? I w-was laughing the entire time… You’re very funny, Zhongli. M-Morax, who couldn’t relinquish… just… even one contract.”
	“You’re not leaving me, Guizhong!” I shout. “Stop talking like that!” My world can’t come crumbling down, I want to say, You are my world, I want to say. But… such words, like my divine contracts, are inexplicable and equally irrevocable. Does she even want to hear that now? I never told her– there are so many roads not taken. Why did I never tell her–
	She smiles, her face serene despite my tears. “But I must, Zhongli. For every god, a place– a constellation among the stars.” 
	“Guizhong… you…” I inhale sharply. “I already told you! Your heart is good and pure, your soul is beautiful…” …your feet and mind and arms anchor my earth. I’m… so sorry… If the world could rival my grief… it would end, right here, right now. Each breath you take is precious to me, and I can’t bear the thought of you not being by my side with me in Liyue, in Teyvat, in Chenyu Vale. “You don’t deserve this…” …and I don’t deserve you. 
	Why did I never tell her how much I–
She brushes away some of my tears, cupping my face in her hand, and I rest my hand over hers. She reaches to one of the Glaze Lilies. “They really like it when you sing to them,” she whispers.
	Why did I never tell her how much I loved her?!
	Her gnosis flickers dark, and I clutch her body close, kissing her fingertips, but she dissolves into Glaze Lily petals. My hands tighten around her kimono until that fades too, leaving me kneeling, shivering among the flowers, holding nothing but memories of dust.
	And I hear silence. I’m the only god left. I don’t want to be the only god in Liyue–not without Guizhong. If I, Lord of Geo and Contracts, am the only god in Liyue, I must be the Archon of Geo.
	I lift a hand to my chest, almost reaching into my heart and ripping out my gnosis, but I stop. I don’t want this. I want Guizhong back. I want world love life I loved her too much Guizhong back. The earth splits at my tears and grief, the wind wailing at my empty, empty arms. I close my eyes when it starts to rain, tears dripping down my face, rain landing heavy on my lashes.
	I tilt my head to the sky and scream.
